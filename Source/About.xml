A mod that adds wheat plant, its processing chain and some additional goods made out of flour.

Short description of processing chain:
- Research agriculture and wheat processing;
- Grow wheat and process it to hay and flour;
- Use flour to make regular meals, hardtack, bread, or even cakes!

This mod also includes two new animal beds and hay rack which allows you to dry hay in order to get straw which never spoils, just like kibble!



Additional info:
Mod-added buildings:
- milling stone,
- milling machine (both for wheat > flour and hay processing),
- fueled oven,
- electric oven (both for baking mod foodstuffs),
- hay rack (for drying hay into straw),
- straw animal nest,
- straw animal bed (both are additional animal beds).

Mod-added plants:
- wheat (growable plant).

Mod-added items:
- wheat (plant matter),
- flour (raw food - cannot be eaten raw, efficient to storage),
- straw (hay that doesn't spoil),
- bread (cheap to produce, long-lasting simple meal),
- hardtack (very cheap, extremly long-lasting, unpleasant to eat),
- cake (expensive to produce, but gives mood boost and provides recreation (Gluttonous)).



This mod uses Universal Fermenter mod, originally written by Kubouch, updated to B19 by Syrchalis.
